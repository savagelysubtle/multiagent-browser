# Codebase Analysis Assistant

I'll help you analyze your codebase systematically using our integrated MCP tools and resources.

## Step 1: Gather Project Information
First, let's understand your project structure using our available tools:
- Use `file_tree` tool to see the overall organization with configurable depth
- Use `codebase_ingest` tool to get detailed file contents with smart filtering
- Check `filesystem://project-summary` resource for quick overview
- Check `filesystem://current-tree` resource for immediate directory structure

## Step 2: Pre-Analysis Planning
Use our reasoning tools to plan the analysis:
- `sequential_think` with the analysis task to break it down systematically
- `decompose_problem` if the codebase is complex and needs structured analysis
- `solve_with_tools` to plan the optimal tool usage sequence for this specific analysis

- `reflect_on_solution` - Solution validation and improvement recommendations

### Filesystem and Code Analysis Tools:
- `file_tree` - Directory structure analysis with configurable depth and filtering
- `codebase_ingest` - Intelligent code analysis with pattern matching and summarization
- Resources: `filesystem://project-summary`, `filesystem://current-tree`

### Database and IDE Integration Tools:
- `query_cursor_database` - Cursor IDE data access for projects, chats, and composer sessions
- Resources: `cursor://projects` for project discovery and analysis

### System Extension Tools:
- `manage_plugins` - Plugin management for extending MCP server capabilities

## Step 3: Workflow Design Patterns
Based on task type, consider these proven patterns:

### For Code Analysis Tasks:
```
1. filesystem://project-summary → Overview
2. sequential_think → Plan analysis approach
3. file_tree → Structure understanding
4. codebase_ingest → Detailed code analysis
5. analyze_dependencies → Relationship mapping
6. reflect_on_solution → Validate findings
```

### For Problem Solving Tasks:
```
1. sequential_think → Problem breakdown
2. decompose_problem → Sub-task identification
3. solve_with_tools → Tool sequence planning
4. [Apply domain tools] → Execute analysis
5. reflect_on_solution → Solution validation
```

### For Research and Investigation Tasks:
```
1. cursor://projects → Available data discovery
2. sequential_think → Research methodology planning
3. query_cursor_database → Data collection
4. analyze_dependencies → Pattern analysis
5. reflect_on_solution → Insight synthesis
```

## Step 4: Optimization Strategies
Design your workflow for maximum effectiveness:

### Parallel Processing Opportunities:
- Combine `filesystem://project-summary` with `cursor://projects` for comprehensive context
- Use `file_tree` alongside `sequential_think` for simultaneous structure and strategy analysis
- Apply `analyze_dependencies` in parallel with detailed code analysis

### Sequential Dependencies:
- Always use `sequential_think` or `decompose_problem` before complex tool orchestration
- Apply `solve_with_tools` after understanding requirements but before execution
- Use `reflect_on_solution` as final validation after main analysis is complete

### Feedback Loops:
- Use `reflect_on_solution` outputs to inform subsequent `sequential_think` iterations
- Apply insights from `analyze_dependencies` to refine `decompose_problem` strategies
- Use `solve_with_tools` to continuously optimize workflow based on intermediate results

## Step 5: Task-Specific Orchestration for: "{task}"

### Recommended Workflow:
1. **Planning**: Start with `sequential_think` to understand task requirements
2. **Strategy**: Use `solve_with_tools` to design optimal approach for this specific task
3. **Context**: Gather relevant information using appropriate data tools
4. **Analysis**: Apply analytical tools based on task domain and requirements
5. **Integration**: Use `analyze_dependencies` if multiple components are involved
6. **Validation**: Apply `reflect_on_solution` to ensure quality and completeness

### Success Metrics:
- **Efficiency**: Minimal tool calls while maximizing information gathering
- **Completeness**: All task aspects addressed systematically
- **Quality**: Validated results with clear reasoning and evidence
- **Reusability**: Approach can be adapted for similar future tasks

## Advanced Integration Techniques:
- **Chained Analysis**: Use output from one tool as input to the next in the sequence
- **Parallel Context Building**: Gather different types of context simultaneously
- **Iterative Refinement**: Use reflection to improve analysis quality progressively
- **Adaptive Sequencing**: Adjust tool sequence based on intermediate findings
