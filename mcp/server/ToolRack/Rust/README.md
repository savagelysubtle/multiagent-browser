# AiChemistForge - Rust Filesystem MCP Server

This Rust MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides a suite of high-performance, asynchronous tools for filesystem operations. It is designed for efficiency, safety, and robust interaction with the file system. While part of the larger AiChemistForge project, this server can be compiled, run, and utilized as a standalone component.

It serves as a Rust-based alternative and enhancement to filesystem servers typically found in Node.js or other environments, leveraging Rust's strengths in speed, memory safety, and concurrency.

Refer to the [online project documentation](https://rust-mcp-stack.github.io/rust-mcp-filesystem) for more general information about the original `rust-mcp-filesystem` project that this server is based on.

## Features

- **âš¡ High Performance**: Built with Rust and Tokio for asynchronous, non-blocking I/O, ensuring efficient handling of filesystem tasks.
- **ðŸ”’ Security Conscious**: Operates with a configurable allow-list for accessible directory paths. Write operations require explicit flags.
- **Advanced Glob Searching**: Powerful file and directory searching using glob patterns.
- **Comprehensive Filesystem Operations**: Offers a wide range of tools for file/directory manipulation, reading, writing, and metadata retrieval.
- **Standalone Binary**: Compiles to a single native executable with no external runtime dependencies (like Node.js or Python), making deployment straightforward.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource footprint, suitable for various deployment scenarios.

## Available Tools

This server exposes a rich set of filesystem tools. Based on `src/tools.rs`, the available tools include:

*   **`read_file`**: Reads the content of a single text file.
*   **`create_directory`**: Creates a new directory, including parent directories if needed.
*   **`directory_tree`**: Generates a recursive tree view of a directory's contents.
*   **`edit_file`**: Performs line-based edits on a text file.
*   **`get_file_info`**: Retrieves detailed metadata for a file or directory.
*   **`list_allowed_directories`**: Lists the base directory paths the server is permitted to access.
*   **`list_directory`**: Provides a listing of files and subdirectories within a specified directory.
*   **`move_file`**: Moves or renames a file or directory.
*   **`read_multiple_files`**: Reads the content of multiple text files.
*   **`search_files`**: Recursively searches for files and directories matching a glob pattern.
*   **`write_file`**: Writes content to a file, creating or overwriting it.
*   **`zip_files`**: Compresses specified files into a ZIP archive.
*   **`unzip_file`**: Decompresses a ZIP archive.
*   **`zip_directory`**: Compresses an entire directory into a ZIP archive.

Each tool has specific input parameters and output formats, adhering to MCP standards. The `require_write_access()` method in `tools.rs` indicates which tools perform modifying operations.

## Installation & Building

### Prerequisites
- **Rust Toolchain**: Ensure you have Rust installed (typically via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)). This will include `cargo`, the Rust package manager and build tool.
- **UV Package Manager (Optional, for npx usage shown in batch file)**: If you intend to use the `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` with `uv`, you'll need `uv` installed. For building and running the Rust server itself, only `cargo` is strictly necessary.

### Building the Server

1.  **Clone the Server Directory (if not already part of a larger clone):**
    If treating this as a standalone project, clone its specific directory or the parent AiChemistForge repository and navigate here.
    ```bash
    # Example if AiChemistForge is cloned:
    # git clone https://github.com/your-username/AiChemistForge.git
    cd AiChemistForge/ToolRack/Rust
    ```

2.  **Build with Cargo:**
    Navigate to the `AiChemistForge/ToolRack/Rust/` directory (where `Cargo.toml` is located) and run:
    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```
    For a release build (optimized):
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```
    The compiled binary will be located in `target/debug/rust_mcp_server` or `target/release/rust_mcp_server`.

## Usage

### Running the Server Directly

Once built, you can run the server executable directly from the `target` directory or by using `cargo run`:

```bash
# Using cargo run (from the ToolRack/Rust/ directory)
cargo run --manifest-path ./Cargo.toml -- [--allow-write] [ALLOWED_PATH_1] [ALLOWED_PATH_2] ...
```

**Explanation of Arguments:**
-   `--manifest-path ./Cargo.toml`: Specifies the project's manifest file.
-   `--`: Separates `cargo run` options from the arguments passed to the server binary itself.
-   `--allow-write` (Optional): A flag that enables tools capable of modifying the filesystem (e.g., `write_file`, `create_directory`, `move_file`, `edit_file`, `zip_files`, `unzip_file`, `zip_directory`). Without this flag, these tools will likely be restricted or disabled for safety.
-   `[ALLOWED_PATH_1] [ALLOWED_PATH_2] ...`: A space-separated list of absolute directory paths that the server is permitted to access. The server will restrict all its operations to these directories and their subdirectories.

**Example:**
To run the server allowing write access to `D:/Coding/AiChemistCodex/AiChemistForge/ToolRack/Rust/test_files` and read-only access to `F:/` and `D:/`:
```bash
cargo run --manifest-path ./Cargo.toml -- --allow-write "D:/Coding/AiChemistCodex/AiChemistForge/ToolRack/Rust/test_files" "F:/" "D:/"
```

### Using the `mcp_rust_tool.bat` (Windows, with MCP Inspector)

The provided `mcp_rust_tool.bat` script demonstrates running the server with the `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` and `uv` for a more integrated development/testing experience.

```batch
@echo off
setlocal

set "RUST_LOG=debug"

REM The npx command invokes the MCP inspector, which then runs the Rust server via uv and cargo.
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector ^
  uv ^
  --directory "D:/Coding/AiChemistCodex/AiChemistForge/ToolRack/Rust/" ^
  run cargo ^
  run ^
  --manifest-path "D:/Coding/AiChemistCodex/AiChemistForge/ToolRack/Rust/Cargo.toml" ^
  -- ^
  --allow-write ^
  "D:/Coding/AiChemistCodex/AiChemistForge/ToolRack/Rust/test_files" ^
  "F:/" ^
  "D:/"

endlocal
```

**Key aspects of the batch file:**
-   Sets `RUST_LOG=debug` for verbose logging from the Rust application.
-   Uses `npx` to run the MCP inspector.
-   The inspector is configured to use `uv` to execute `cargo run`.
-   `--directory` specifies the working directory for `uv`.
-   The arguments after `--` are passed to the Rust MCP server binary, including `--allow-write` and the allowed paths.

**To use this batch file:**
1.  Ensure Node.js (for `npx`) and `uv` are installed and in your PATH.
2.  Update the absolute paths within the batch file if your AiChemistForge project is located elsewhere.
3.  Run `mcp_rust_tool.bat` from your command prompt.

### Connecting from an MCP Client (e.g., Cursor)

To connect this Rust MCP server to a client like Cursor:

1.  **Cursor Settings:**
    Navigate to `Features > Model Context Protocol` in Cursor's settings.

2.  **Add Server Configuration:**
    *   **If using the batch file (recommended for easy configuration):**
        *   **Command:** Absolute path to `mcp_rust_tool.bat` (e.g., `D:\\Coding\\AiChemistCodex\\AiChemistForge\\mcp_rust_tool.bat`).
        *   **CWD (Current Working Directory):** Absolute path to the `AiChemistForge/` directory (or wherever `mcp_rust_tool.bat` is best executed from, usually the repo root or `ToolRack/Rust/`).
    *   **If running `cargo run` directly (more complex for client setup):**
        You would need to construct the full `cargo run ...` command as the "command" field in Cursor, ensuring all paths are absolute and correctly escaped.
        *   **Command (example):** `cargo run --manifest-path D:\Coding\AiChemistCodex\AiChemistForge\ToolRack\Rust\Cargo.toml -- --allow-write D:\Coding\AiChemistCodex\AiChemistForge\ToolRack\Rust\test_files F:\ D:\` (Paths need correct escaping for JSON).
        *   **CWD:** `D:\Coding\AiChemistCodex\AiChemistForge\ToolRack\Rust`

    Example JSON for Cursor settings (using the batch file):
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "aichemistforge-rust-server": { // Choose a unique name
          "command": "D:\\Coding\\AiChemistCodex\\AiChemistForge\\mcp_rust_tool.bat",
          "cwd": "D:\\Coding\\AiChemistCodex\\AiChemistForge"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    **Note:** Adjust paths and use double backslashes (`\\`) for paths in JSON on Windows.

## Development

### Project Structure
Key files and directories within `ToolRack/Rust/`:
-   `Cargo.toml`: The Rust project manifest, defining dependencies and project metadata.
-   `src/`: Contains the Rust source code.
    -   `main.rs`: The main entry point for the server application.
    -   `tools.rs`: Defines the `FileSystemTools` enum, tool registration (`tool_box!`), and the `require_write_access` logic. It imports individual tool modules.
    -   `tools/`: A directory containing modules for each specific tool (e.g., `create_directory.rs`, `read_files.rs`).
-   `docs/_media/`: Contains media like logos.
-   `tests/`: Contains integration or unit tests for the server and its tools.
-   `mcp_rust_tool.bat` (in parent `AiChemistForge` dir): Example batch script to run the server with an inspector.

### Adding New Tools

1.  **Create a New Tool Module:**
    In the `src/tools/` directory, create a new Rust file (e.g., `my_new_tool.rs`).
    Implement the tool logic, typically by defining a struct and implementing the `rust_mcp_sdk::Tool` trait (or by following the pattern of existing tools if they use a different abstraction provided by `rust-mcp-sdk`).
    ```rust
    // Example structure (may vary based on rust-mcp-sdk specifics)
    use rust_mcp_sdk::mcp_tool_frontend; // or similar macros/traits
    use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

    #[derive(Deserialize, Debug)] // For input parameters
    pub struct MyNewToolParams {
        pub example_param: String,
    }

    #[derive(Serialize, Debug)] // For tool output
    pub struct MyNewToolResult {
        pub message: String,
    }

    mcp_tool_frontend! {
        MyNewTool, // Tool name
        "A description of my new tool.", // Tool description
        MyNewToolParams, // Input parameter type
        MyNewToolResult // Output type
    }

    impl MyNewTool {
        pub async fn run(params: MyNewToolParams) -> Result<MyNewToolResult, anyhow::Error> {
            // Your tool logic here
            Ok(MyNewToolResult {
                message: format!("Processed: {}", params.example_param),
            })
        }
    }
    ```

2.  **Register the Tool in `tools.rs`:**
    -   Add `mod my_new_tool;` at the top of `src/tools.rs`.
    -   Add `pub use my_new_tool::MyNewToolTool;` (or the appropriate generated name) to the `pub use` statements.
    -   Include `MyNewToolTool` in the `tool_box!` macro invocation.
    -   Update the `require_write_access` match statement if your new tool modifies the filesystem.

3.  **Rebuild:**
    Run `cargo build` or `cargo run` to compile the changes.
