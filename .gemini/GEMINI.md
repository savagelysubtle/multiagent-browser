# Gemini Task Log

## Goal: Re-architect the application's API to use the `ag-ui` protocol.

### Steps Taken:

1.  **Initial Analysis:**
    *   Reviewed the project structure and existing code.
    *   Read the `ag-ui` protocol documentation to understand the new architecture.

2.  **Backend Implementation:**
    *   Added `ag-ui-protocol==0.1.9` to `pyproject.toml`.
    *   Created a new FastAPI router at `backend/src/web_ui/api/routes/ag_ui.py`.
    *   Implemented a `/chat` endpoint on the new router to handle `ag-ui` requests.
    *   The endpoint is a simple echo agent that streams a "Hello from ag-ui!" message.
    *   Integrated the new router into the main FastAPI application in `backend/src/web_ui/api/server.py`.

3.  **Frontend Implementation:**
    *   Added `@ag-ui/client` and `@ag-ui/core` to `frontend/package.json`.
    *   Created a new service `frontend/src/services/agUiService.ts` to manage the `HttpAgent`.
    *   Refactored the chat functionality in `frontend/src/views/EditorView.tsx` to use the new `agUiService`.

### Errors Encountered and Resolutions:

1.  **`npm install` failed:**
    *   **Error:** `npm error notarget No matching version found for @ag-ui/client@^0.1.9.`
    *   **Resolution:** Searched for the correct version on npm and found that `@ag-ui/client` is at version `0.0.37` and `@ag-ui/core` is at `0.0.39`. Updated `frontend/package.json` with the correct versions.

2.  **Frontend Compilation Error:**
    *   **Error:** `D:/Coding/web-ui/frontend/src/views/EditorView.tsx:185:7: ERROR: Unexpected "{" `
    *   **Resolution:** The import statements for `agUiService` and `AgentSubscriber` were incorrectly placed inside the component function. Moved the import statements to the top of the file.

### Final State:

*   The backend is equipped with a new `ag-ui` compatible endpoint.
*   The frontend is refactored to use the `ag-ui` protocol for chat communication.
*   The application is ready for testing.
