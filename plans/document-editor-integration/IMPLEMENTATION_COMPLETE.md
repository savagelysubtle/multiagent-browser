2. Configure your LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.)
3. Set your API key and model preferences
4. Return to Document Editor - agent features will now work!

### File Security
- Documents are saved in `./tmp/documents/` directory
- Backups are stored in `./tmp/document_backups/`
- Only files within safe directories can be accessed
- All file operations are logged for security

## 📁 File Structure Created

```
./tmp/
├── documents/
│   ├── examples/
│   │   ├── sample.md     # Markdown example
│   │   ├── sample.py     # Python example  
│   │   └── sample.json   # JSON example
│   └── [your-files]/     # Your created files
└── document_backups/     # Automatic backups
```

## 🎯 Example Use Cases
